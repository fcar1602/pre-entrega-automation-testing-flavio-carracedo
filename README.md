# Pre-Entrega: Selenium + Python Automation Testing

This repository contains a Selenium-based UI test suite implemented with Python and Pytest. It's organized as a simple page-object driven test project against the SauceDemo demo site (https://www.saucedemo.com). The intent is to provide a clean, reproducible pre-delivery (pre-entrega) automation testing submission.

## Project status
- Tests currently exercise the SauceDemo application: login, navigation, add-to-cart flows.
- HTML report (`report.html`) is generated by pytest-html when tests are executed with appropriate addopts.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+ (project was tested on Python 3.12)
- pip
- Git
- A browser (Chrome / Firefox) and the matching WebDriver (chromedriver/geckodriver)

## Installation
1. Create and activate a virtual environment (PowerShell):

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

2. Install dependencies 

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt

pip install selenium pytest pytest-html
```

## How to run tests with Report


```powershell
python -m pytest preEntrega/tests -v --html=report.html --self-contained-html
```

Run a single test file:

```powershell
python -m pytest preEntrega/tests/test_login.py -v --html=report.html --self-contained-html

```

## Recommended browser drivers
- Chrome: download `chromedriver` matching your Chrome version and place it in your PATH or in `drivers/` folder. 
- Firefox: download `geckodriver` and add to PATH.

For local debugging it's easiest to place the driver executable in a `drivers/` directory and update your `conftest.py` to point to it.

## Key design decisions
- Page Object Model: pages contain page-specific logic and locators. Reusable waiting and low-level helpers are in `utils/helpers.py`.
- Tests are written with pytest; fixtures are used to set up and tear down WebDriver instances.
- Logging in tests uses standard `logging` and `caplog` for capturing logs in html reports.

## Adding new tests
- Create or reuse page objects in `preEntrega/pages/`.
- Add higher-level actions to page classes, keep waits and low-level helpers in `preEntrega/utils/helpers.py`.
- Write tests in `preEntrega/tests/` using pytest and assert plain English messages.

## CI / GitHub Actions guidance
- Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to run `pytest --html=report.html` in the matrix for desired browsers.
- Store `report.html` as a workflow artifact for later download.
- Use official actions to install matching browser and driver versions (for example, use `actions/setup-python` and `browser-actions/setup-chromedriver` or download driver manually).

## Troubleshooting
- Fixture 'driver' not found: ensure `conftest.py` is in `preEntrega/` or `preEntrega/tests/` and defines the `driver` fixture.
- Element timing issues: use helpers' `wait_for_visibility` / `wait_for_clickable`.
- Mismatched driver versions: update driver to match your browser.

## Contributing / Commit message guidance
- Make frequent, small commits with descriptive messages like:
  - `feat: add LoginPage and login test`
  - `fix: update selector for add-to-cart button`
  - `chore: add README and requirements`

If you need help or want me to finalize the repository (create `requirements.txt`, add CI workflow, or run tests here), tell me which task to do next.
